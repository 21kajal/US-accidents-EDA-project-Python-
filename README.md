# Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accidents with 7.7 million records.
This dataset offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and factors influencing accidents across the country. The project aims to uncover valuable information that can contribute to improving road safety, emergency response systems, and urban planning.

## Business Problem Statement: 

This portfolio project encompasses an exploratory data analysis of 7.7 million records of accidents in the United States. The goal is to gain insights into cities with the highest accident rates, assess the severity of accidents, and conduct analyses on weather conditions and road features. 

Overview of the Dataset: 

Prepare the data by performing cleaning procedures and offer a summary of the dataset. 

Comprehend the overall distribution of accidents and identify the cities with the highest number of accidents. 

Investigate the severity of accidents and the yearly trend. 

Determine the distribution of accidents on weekdays and weekends, as well as the time-of-day accidents occur. 

Conduct road feature and weather analysis to find out whether these factors have any influence on the accidents.

## Outcome:

In conclusion, this EDA project not only unveils significant patterns and trends in US accidents but also provides actionable insights for stakeholders involved in traffic safety and urban planning. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of accident dynamics, guiding targeted efforts for accident prevention and improved emergency response strategies.
